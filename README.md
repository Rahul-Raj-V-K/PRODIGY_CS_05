# Network Packet Sniffer


A network packet sniffer is a tool used to capture, analyze, and monitor data packets traveling over a network. These packets contain various forms of data, such as web traffic, emails, or file transfers, and the sniffer can intercept and log this information for further examination. Network administrators and security professionals commonly use packet sniffers to troubleshoot network issues, ensure network performance, and detect unauthorized or malicious activities. Popular tools like Wireshark provide a user-friendly interface for packet sniffing, offering insights into network operations and helping to secure and optimize network infrastructure.
